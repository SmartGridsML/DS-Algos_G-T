/*
removing an element at the tail of a singly
linked list is not easy. Indeed, it is time consuming to remove any node other than
the head in a singly linked list, since we do not have a quick way of accessing the
node immediately preceding the one we want to remove. There are many applications
where we do not have quick access to such a predecessor node. For such
applications, it would be nice to have a way of going both directions in a linked list.
